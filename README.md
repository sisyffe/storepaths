# The `storepath` library

## Intro

This is a C/C++ cross-platform library used to retrieve application specific data folders such as configuration, data, cache... folders. 
Strongly inspired from [this cfgpath library by Malvineous](https://github.com/Malvineous/cfgpath).
The difference is that it is not a simple header file it is now full library.
You can use this library **in C and in C++**, the single header you include is compatible.

Implemented platform as of now:
- macOS
- Windows
- linux

## Compiling

Just execute CMake (other information will be written later).

## Usage

**_Please consider that this library is in development. It is not fully finished._**
